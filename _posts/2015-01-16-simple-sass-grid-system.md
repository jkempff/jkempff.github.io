A simple to use, easily customize and non-headache grid system.

It follows the `.module__submodule--variation` class name definition and is therefore readable.

You may customize `$grid-steps` and `$grid-gutter` to whatever value you need.

And here it is, ready to be included in your hologram styleguide:
