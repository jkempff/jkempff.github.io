Hello everyone.

I'm not going to explain my self, but as a webdeveloper you are kind of supposed to have your own, personal website.

And here it is!

It's as simple as it could be. The "design" is simply created with (very awesome) [tachyons.css](http://tachyons.io/), and everything else is a basic jekyll github-page. Nothing fancy here.

Best, Ju
